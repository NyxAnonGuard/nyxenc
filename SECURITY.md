# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Model

NyxEnc implements a zero-trust security model with the following principles:

1. **Client-Side Only**
   - All encryption/decryption happens in the user's browser
   - Server never sees plaintext content or encryption keys
   - No key transmission over the network

2. **Cryptographic Standards**
   - AES-256-CBC for content encryption (FIPS 140-2 approved)
   - PBKDF2-SHA256 for key derivation (10,000-150,000 iterations)
   - HMAC-SHA256 for file integrity
   - Ed25519 for wallet signatures
   - Constant-time comparisons for HMAC verification

3. **Key Derivation Security**
   - Keys are derived from multiple factors:
     - Wallet address
     - Creation timestamp
     - High-entropy nonce (256 bits)
     - Payment proof (for paid content)
   - No keys are ever stored or transmitted

4. **File Format Security**
   - Versioned file format
   - Tamper-proof signature
   - Metadata validation
   - Expiration enforcement

5. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Wallet ownership verification
   - Payment enforcement at cryptographic level
   - Transaction proof validation

## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in NyxEnc, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Email [your-security-email@domain.com](mailto:your-security-email@domain.com) with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to:
1. Confirm the vulnerability
2. Fix the issue
3. Credit you in our security acknowledgments (if desired)

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are NOT considered vulnerabilities:
- Issues in dependencies (report to their maintainers)
- Issues requiring physical access to the user's device
- Social engineering attacks
- DOS attacks on the server (we're client-side only)

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

When using NyxEnc:

1. **Keep your wallet secure**
   - Use a hardware wallet when possible
   - Never share private keys
   - Keep wallet software updated

2. **Content Security**
   - Set appropriate expiration times
   - Use strong wallet addresses
   - Validate recipient addresses

3. **Integration Security**
   - Always use HTTPS
   - Validate all user input
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
